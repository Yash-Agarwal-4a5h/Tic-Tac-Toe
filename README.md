This Tic Tac Toe game is a lightweight, browser-based implementation built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features classic two-player gameplay (X vs O), automatic win/draw detection, a live score tracker, and a responsive design. Players take turns clicking cells to mark X or O, with the first to align three symbols winning. A restart button allows for quick rematches. No installation is neededâ€”simply open index.html to play. The project consists of three core files: index.html (structure), style.css (styling), and script.js (game logic). A fun, minimalist take on the timeless classic!
